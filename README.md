# AWS Lambda with Serverless Framework

Made with [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com/framework/) and [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), these simple cloud functions can be used for creating JWT tokens for authentication across different personal projects. These functions are deployed to AWS Lambda and can be invoked from anywhere with REST API. I plan to use this function for creating JWT tokens for authentication across different personal projects. Thank you for reading this documentation. Contact me for obtaining the API endpoint.
