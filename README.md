# AWS Lambda with Serverless Framework

Made with [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com/framework/) and [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), these simple cloud functions can be used for creating JWT tokens for authentication across different personal projects. These functions are deployed to AWS Lambda and can be invoked from anywhere with REST API. I plan to use this function for creating JWT tokens for authentication across different personal projects. The idea is the signed JWT token can be verified on a different backend or frontend or what-have-you since it will have the same JWT secret and all you need to do is POST and GET request. Password are hashed and encrypted with Bcyrpt and stored in DynamoDB. Thank you for reading this documentation. Contact me for obtaining the API endpoint.
